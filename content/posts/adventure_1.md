# Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Can we have Bender Burgers again? __Bender, we're trying our best.__ *I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.* Leela's gonna kill me.

## Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

1. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
2. And then the battle's not so bad?
3. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

### I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! You don't know how to do any of those. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

* Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
* That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
* Ask her how her day was.

So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Oh God, what have I done? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. You know, I was God once. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Kids have names?

Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Oh yeah, good luck with that. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! You're going to do his laundry? Ooh, name it after me!

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Your best is an idiot!
