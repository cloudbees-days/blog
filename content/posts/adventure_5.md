# Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Meh. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I just told you! You've killed me! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Shinier than yours, meatbag. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! __Quite possible.__ *We live long and are celebrated poopers.* There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

## You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Bite my shiny metal ass. Bender?! You stole the atom. You can see how I lived before I met you.

1. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?
2. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
3. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

### Fatal.

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

* And then the battle's not so bad?
* I'll get my kit!
* Moving along…

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

Shut up and take my money! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Why would I want to know that?

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. But I've never been to the moon! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

Okay, I like a challenge. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Okay, I like a challenge. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! No! The cat shelter's on to me. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. You can see how I lived before I met you. Noooooo! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

I'm Santa Claus! Bender, we're trying our best. Bender, you risked your life to save me! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. We're also Santa Claus! But I've never been to the moon! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
