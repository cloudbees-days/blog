# Can we have Bender Burgers again?

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Is that a cooking show? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. __THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN!__ *I AM THE GREETEST!* NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

## I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. You're going to do his laundry? Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

1. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
2. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
3. That's not soon enough!

### Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Okay, I like a challenge. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

* Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
* Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
* There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Hey, whatcha watching? You are the last hope of the universe. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Shut up and get to the point! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.

Daylight and everything. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." We're rescuing ya. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

Ow, my spirit! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Ask her how her day was. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Take me to your leader! Soon enough.

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. And then the battle's not so bad? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Can I use the gun? Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! You lived before you met me?!

Why did you bring us here? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Tell her she looks thin. So, how 'bout them Knicks?

I wish! It's a nickel. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Kids have names? It's toe-tappingly tragic! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
