# Can we have Bender Burgers again?

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. It doesn't look so shiny to me.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Is that a cooking show? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. __THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN!__ *I AM THE GREETEST!* NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

## I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. You're going to do his laundry? Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

1. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
2. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
3. That's not soon enough!

### Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Okay, I like a challenge. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

* Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
* Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
* There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Hey, whatcha watching? You are the last hope of the universe. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Shut up and get to the point! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.

Daylight and everything. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." We're rescuing ya. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

Ow, my spirit! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Ask her how her day was. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Take me to your leader! Soon enough.

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. And then the battle's not so bad? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Can I use the gun? Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! You lived before you met me?!

Why did you bring us here? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Tell her she looks thin. So, how 'bout them Knicks?

I wish! It's a nickel. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Kids have names? It's toe-tappingly tragic! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

# Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Meh. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I just told you! You've killed me! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Shinier than yours, meatbag. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! __Quite possible.__ *We live long and are celebrated poopers.* There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

## You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Bite my shiny metal ass. Bender?! You stole the atom. You can see how I lived before I met you.

1. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?
2. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
3. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

### Fatal.

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

* And then the battle's not so bad?
* I'll get my kit!
* Moving along…

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

Shut up and take my money! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Why would I want to know that?

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. But I've never been to the moon! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

Okay, I like a challenge. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Okay, I like a challenge. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! No! The cat shelter's on to me. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. You can see how I lived before I met you. Noooooo! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

I'm Santa Claus! Bender, we're trying our best. Bender, you risked your life to save me! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. We're also Santa Claus! But I've never been to the moon! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
