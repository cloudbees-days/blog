# WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. __That's right, baby.__ *I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.* You even love anyone pretending to be him!

## Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

You are the last hope of the universe. When will that be? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

1. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
2. Say it in Russian!
3. It's toe-tappingly tragic!

### Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Fatal. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Ask her how her day was. Your best is an idiot!

* There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!
* I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I'm Santa Claus! Ow, my spirit! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

No, she'll probably make me do it. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

I'm Santa Claus! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Negative, bossy meat creature!

Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. You can see how I lived before I met you.

Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Do a flip! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

Yeah, lots of people did. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? But existing is basically all I do! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

Can we have Bender Burgers again? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! No, I'm Santa Claus!

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Noooooo! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

She also liked to shut up! Noooooo! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. They're like sex, except I'm having them! A true inspiration for the children.

You are the last hope of the universe. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?
