# Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Yeah, lots of people did. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Professor, make a woman out of me. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. __Really?!__ *Oh Leela!* You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

## They're like sex, except I'm having them!

And until then, I can never die? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

1. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
2. And then the battle's not so bad?
3. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

### You mean while I'm sleeping in it?

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Really?! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

* It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
* Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!
* I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Bite my shiny metal ass. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Who are those horrible orange men? Moving along…

You are the last hope of the universe. I love you, buddy! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! It doesn't look so shiny to me.

One hundred dollars. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! I had more, but you go ahead. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

It's a T. It goes "tuh". You can see how I lived before I met you. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Negative, bossy meat creature!
