# Fatal.

No! Don't jump! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? __Bender, we're trying our best.__ *I never loved you.* I'm Santa Claus!

## Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? I wish! It's a nickel. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

1. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
2. How much did you make me?
3. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

### I don't want to be rescued.

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Oh God, what have I done? Bender, you risked your life to save me! You don't know how to do any of those. I never loved you.

* Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
* Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
* This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

No, I'm Santa Claus! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Is that a cooking show? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

A sexy mistake. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Large bet on myself in round one. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

We're rescuing ya. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Say it in Russian! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

Fatal. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Large bet on myself in round one.

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

We're rescuing ya. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Fatal.

Why did you bring us here? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Why would a robot need to drink? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!
