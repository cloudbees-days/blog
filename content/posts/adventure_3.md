# Daylight and everything.

Kif might! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. __Also he got a race car.__ *Is any of this getting through to you?* You know, I was God once.

## You lived before you met me?!

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. It's toe-tappingly tragic! A sexy mistake. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

1. Ask her how her day was.
2. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
3. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

### A true inspiration for the children.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

* Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.
* For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.
* Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. A sexy mistake. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Bender, we're trying our best.

And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Bender, we're trying our best. No! Don't jump! Hey, whatcha watching?

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Guess again. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. I had more, but you go ahead. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Really?! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. A sexy mistake. Why did you bring us here? What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! A sexy mistake.

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! They're like sex, except I'm having them! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. No, she'll probably make me do it. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
